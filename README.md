# 🦅 Bird Detection and Deterrence System for Crop Protection  

## 📌 Overview  
Birds can cause significant damage to crops, leading to financial losses for farmers. Traditional methods like scarecrows and noise deterrents are ineffective over time.  

This project presents an **automated, real-time bird detection and deterrence system** that uses **computer vision and deep learning** to identify birds in a video feed. Upon detection, the system **triggers an alarm** to scare birds away, reducing crop damage.  

This system is particularly useful for **agriculture, conservation research, and wildlife monitoring**.

## 🎯 Features  
✅ **Real-time Bird Detection** using YOLOv5 and OpenCV  
✅ **Automatic Siren Activation** when a bird is detected  
✅ **Live Video Feed Processing** for continuous monitoring  
✅ **Pre-trained Deep Learning Model** for accurate recognition  
✅ **Customizable Alert Sound** to suit different environments

## 🛠️ How It Works  
1️⃣ **Captures a live video feed** using a webcam.  
2️⃣ **Uses a YOLOv5-based deep learning model** to detect birds.  
3️⃣ **Triggers a siren or buzzer** when a bird is detected.  
4️⃣ **Stops the siren automatically** when no bird is present.  
5️⃣ **User can stop the system anytime** by pressing **'Esc'**.

## 📌 Why is This Useful?  
🌿 **Protects crops and gardens** from bird damage  
🏠 **Prevents birds from nesting** in unwanted areas  
🔊 **No physical harm** to birds—just a harmless sound deterrent  
💡 **Can be modified** to use other alert systems (e.g., flashing lights, sprinklers)
